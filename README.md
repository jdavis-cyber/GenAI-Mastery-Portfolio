# GenAI Engineering Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my Generative AI Mastery Portfolio. This repository demonstrates advanced Generative AI engineering practices using a robust **3-Layer Governance Architecture**. This structure ensures scalable, secure, and maintainable agentic workflows.

## 3-Layer Architecture

This portfolio is organized into three distinct layers of abstraction:

### 1. Directives (Strategy)

High-level rules, principles, and strategic goals that guide the behavior of all agents and systems. These are immutable constraints that ensure alignment with safety and business objectives.

### 2. Orchestration (Management)

The layer responsible for coordinating multiple agents, managing state, and ensuring that tasks are decomposed and delegated effectively. It acts as the bridge between strategy and execution.

### 3. Execution (Tactics)

The implementation layer where specific agents and tools perform concrete tasks. This is where code is written, tests are run, and artifacts are generated.
